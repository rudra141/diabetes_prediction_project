# Diabetes Prediction Project
The Diabetes Prediction Project is a web application that predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on various factors. It utilizes a trained machine learning model to provide accurate predictions. The project includes two files: index.html, which contains the web page code, and app.py, which contains the Flask server code and the implementation of the trained model.

Features
------------
Predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on input factors.
Provides a user-friendly web interface for entering the required information.
Displays the prediction result on the web page.
Utilizes a trained machine learning model to make accurate predictions.

Usage
----------
Visit the website: https://rudra141.pythonanywhere.com.
On the web page, you will find a form requesting information related to pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age.
Enter the required information into the form.
Click the "Submit" button.
The Flask server will process the input and use the trained model to make a prediction.
The prediction result will be displayed on the web page.

Machine Learning

Repository Structure
------------------------
The repository for the Diabetes Prediction Project contains the following files:

index.html: This file contains the HTML code for the web page. It includes the form for entering the input data and displays the prediction result.

app.py: This file contains the Flask server code. It handles the HTTP requests, processes the input data, and uses the trained machine learning model to make predictions.

Trained Model File: The trained machine learning model file is not included in the repository. It should be trained separately and loaded within the app.py file.

Deployment
--------------
The Diabetes Prediction Project is currently deployed on PythonAnywhere. You can access the web application at rudra141.pythonanywhere.com.
